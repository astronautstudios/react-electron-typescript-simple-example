ABOUT ME

Hi! Welcome to Astronaut Studios — that’s the name I use for my personal projects.

My real name is Angela Cervantes, and I’m a Software Engineer who enjoys working on personal projects during my free time.

ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

This isn’t my first time starting an Electron project, nor is it the first time I’ve struggled with something as simple as setting up the initial project files — especially when adding other technologies like React or TypeScript.

This repository serves as a starting point for an application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript. You’ll need to use the appropriate commands to install the necessary libraries, as well as Webpack. You can find more information in the documentation for each technology.
